# hello-world
<b>Hi githubbians!</b><br>
I'm new here.  I really like github from what I've seen thus far.<br>
There was a flag on my account when I first signed up.<br>
That's been fixed: https://archive.vn/GZ2g9 | https://siasky.net/DAB18tPWLstRj2YYUyCJh3MWAC5fPeblfeL6bp4clLc_WA<br>

I think I'm starting to understand how branches work in github.
